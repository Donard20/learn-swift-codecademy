 ## 🚀 Aim:
 
Introducing Enumerations
  
With some forms of information, we know all of the possible values that can exist. Let’s say you’re building a transportation app. Users can either travel by truck, plane, or boat.

We could just use a String to store that information:

*var myRide = "truck"*
  
But that could let us assign myRide to something that’s not a valid ride type:

*myRide = "winged monkeys"*
  
That’d be pretty confusing for a user to see! Fortunately, Swift allows us to restrict the possible values that a variable could be.

An enumeration, often shortened to enum (pronounced ee-num), is a way to define your own group of related values and work with them in a type-safe manner. With the enum below, we’ll always know which vehicles are valid:

*enum Vehicle {
    case airplane
    case boat
    case truck
}*
  
  so instead of creating the new badge template from scratch, we would use the employee badge template to create the manager badge template — that’s inheritance! Because managers are still employees, but also have their own special security clearance.

 ## 👨‍💻 Challenges and Exercises

  Pokédex
  </summary>
  
 
Pokémon is an international phenomenon that has taken the world by storm. Somewhere in a remote village called Pallet Town, there is a Pokémon Professor who is quietly studying these creatures.

We will let him introduce himself:

 > Hello, there! Welcome to the world of Pokémon. My name is Oak. People call me the Pokémon Professor.
 > This world is inhabited by creatures called Pokémon. For some people, Pokémon are pets. Others use them to fight. As for myself… I study pokémon as a profession.

There are over 896 Pokémons now in the wild, each with different characteristics such as name, types, weaknesses, and more. Help Professor Oak study them by categorizing them each into an electronic device — a Pokédex!

 > This project taught me about class. subclassing the different pokemon in Pokedex. learn the overriding of init and methods. the difference between struct and class where struct is a value type, for sample if company needs your license, you will make a copy of it instead of giving them your original ID.  while class is a reference type

<!-- - [x] A class is another means of modeling real-life objects programmatically.
- [x] How to create a class using the class keyword.
- [x] Using the init() method allows us to provide an instance with specific values right off-the-bat during the creation of an instance.
- [x] A class can inherit another class’s properties and methods.
- [x] When using inheritance, the subclass can use the override keyword to redeclare a method with the same name.
- [x] Classes are reference types, any copied class that has its properties altered will affect the original class from which it was copied.
