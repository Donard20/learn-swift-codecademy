 ## 🚀 Aim:
 
As developers, we create programs and applications to solve problems — problems that we encounter on a daily basis that usually stem from everyday life. More often than not, these problems are complex.

Wouldn’t it be nice if we had some sort of data type that would help us model this complexity of everyday life? That way we wouldn’t have to solely rely on basic data types like Strings, Ints, or some collection of these types like arrays, sets, or dictionaries; this data type would combine all these facets and allow us to closely mimic real-world objects.

We don’t have to wonder about this hypothetical situation! That’s what the structure data type, also known as a struct, is for!

With structures, we can create blueprints of everyday objects and use this blueprint to make specific instances of these objects directly in our program.

Let’s imagine that we are building an app and we need to store some user information such as:

Username
Email
Their bio
  
We could make a user structure that serves as the blueprint when creating individual users. Each individual user is an instance of the blueprint but they would still contain their own unique values.

This idea of a blueprint structure provides customization and programmatically allows us to create as many different users as we want. Essentially, we were able to take a complex object like a user and represent them in code!

In this lesson, we’ll learn how to create these structures and how to customize them to suit them to our needs. 🏗️

 > This project taught me how to develop a program with real world data types. The interesting part in here is the structures, init method, instances method and instances for structure that somehow similar and I easily adjusted in coding because I'm a little bit familiar in classes in Python.
 > It's still confusing the last part of coding where I need to call the structures and instances but i will study it more to understand it deeper.

- [x] Structures are a means of modeling real life objects programmatically.
- [x] How to create a structure using the struct keyword along with properties and methods.
- [x] Structure properties are used to describe characteristics and values of
- [x] To model individual objects, we can create instances of structs which may have unique property values.
- [x] We can access and edit properties using dot notation.
- [x] If we know that most of our instances will have a specific property value, we can assign default property values inside the struct.
- [x] Using the init() method allows us to provide an instance with specific values for the structures given properties.
- [x] Even without an init() method, structs come with a default memberwise initialization method that can assign values to declared properties inside a struct.
- [x] Structures can have methods that are functions accessible to their instances.
- [x] Structures are value types, any copied struct that has its properties altered will not affect the original structure from which it was copied.
