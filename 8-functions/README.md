 ## 🚀 Aim:
 
Each program we’ve written so far, whether it tested values against conditional statements or looped for iteration, executed explicitly in the order we’ve laid out and any code that needed to be reused would have to be typed out again.

As our programs get more complex, we’ll seek more efficient ways of organizing our code and aim to avoid repetition. This is where functions truly shine.

Swift functions are chunks of reusable code that achieve a certain outcome. Take a look at Sud City’s carWash() function on the right. The function contains numerous tasks that work together to achieve a clean car. Now each time we’d need our car washed, we wouldn’t build a new car wash, we’d simply reuse the one that already exists.

In this lesson, we’ll explore more scenarios in which functions are useful and learn to define and use them in our code.

 > I learned a lot in this challenge especially in creating array and dictionaries also iterating through variables. It's still new to me some of the codes and quite challenging to think of the way to show the encrypted messages. Thankfully theres a guided instruction on how to do it but sometimes I take a look at hints whenever I feel somethings missing in my code. Its quite confusing in the part of 'currMorse' I didn't fully understand about it but I'll try to look for explanations on the internet. i hope to learn more in loops, dictionaries also the logic of the program, if there's no step by step I don't know if I'm doing correctly.

- [x] A function definition consists of a function name followed by optional parameters and a return type.
- [x] The function body holds the function’s task.
- [x] A function will execute only when it is called.
- [x] A *return* keyword is used to return a value from a function.
- [x] A function’s return type is specified in the function definition followed by an *->*. If a function does not return any values, it’s return type is *Void* or the arrow and type are omitted entirely.
- [x] A *return* statement can be omitted if the function consists of only one expression to return. This is called an implicit return.
- [x] A parameter is a placeholder for a real value passed into a function. A parameter must be enclosed within *()* of a function definition and must have a specific type.
- [x] An argument is a real value passed in for a parameter in the function call.
- [x] A function can accept multiple parameters separated by commas. As many parameters as a function accepts, as many arguments or real values must be passed into the function when it is called.
- [x] A function can return multiple values in the form of a tuple.
- [x] Swift offers support for wide variety of parameter use cases within a function:
   > Default Parameter: a parameter that sets a value to the parameter that will be used if an argument is omitted.
   > Variadic Parameter: a parameter that accepts zero or more values of the parameter’s type.
   > In-out Parameter: a parameter whose value is passed into a function and modified within the body.
