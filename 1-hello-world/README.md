 ## 🚀 Aim:

Swift is a powerful and intuitive general-purpose programming language developed by Apple. Its development started in July 2010.

Much of the inspiration for Swift came from languages like Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C#, and many others. Swift’s concise yet expressive syntax and modern features make it the perfect first language for beginners and one experienced developers enjoy transitioning into.

- Its first version was released in 2014 with the intent to create applications for:
  - 📱 iOS
  - ⌚ watchOS
  - 🖥️ macOS
  - 📺 tvOS
  - 🐧 Linux

 Since then, hundreds of companies including Uber and Slack have incorporated Swift into their tech stack.

> In this lesson, we’ll start by learning the basic concepts and fundamentals of Swift.

Happy coding!
