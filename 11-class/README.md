 ## 🚀 Aim:
 
Introduction to Classes
  
So far, we’ve used several data types, including Int, Double, String, and Bool. We’ve even created our own “type” using structs to make blueprints and templates for objects in our program.

Besides structures, Swift has another construct that also serves as a blueprint or template for an object, a class! A class also defines the characteristics and behaviors of an object. While they feel and behave very similarly, classes come with additional quirks that structures don’t have:

Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another class.
Classes are reference types while structures are value types.
Suppose a company called Hooli gives out ID badges to its employees. Somewhere down the line, the powers that be decide to have a variation of the badges made just for all the managers.

So instead of creating the new badge template from scratch, we would use the employee badge template to create the manager badge template — that’s inheritance! Because managers are still employees, but also have their own special security clearance.

 ## 👨‍💻 Challenges and Exercises

  <summary>
  Swift Bank
  </summary>
  
 
We’ll use properties and access control to build a structure that represents a secure personal bank account. We will be able to initialize the account with a password and initial deposit, make deposits, make withdrawals, and check the balance.

For our bank to remain competitive and earn lots of new customers, we will offer a cash bonus every time a user makes a deposit. Additionally, we’ll configure a property observer to let us know whenever our bank balance is set so that we can display alerts.

We’ll apply the concept of structures, private methods, property observers, and type properties.

 > This project taught me about class. subclassing the different pokemon in Pokedex. learn the overriding of init and methods. the difference between struct and class where struct is a value type, for sample if company needs your license, you will make a copy of it instead of giving them your original ID.  while class is a reference type

- [x] A class is another means of modeling real-life objects programmatically.
- [x] How to create a class using the class keyword.
- [x] Using the init() method allows us to provide an instance with specific values right off-the-bat during the creation of an instance.
- [x] A class can inherit another class’s properties and methods.
- [x] When using inheritance, the subclass can use the override keyword to redeclare a method with the same name.
- [x] Classes are reference types, any copied class that has its properties altered will affect the original class from which it was copied.
    🙌❗
