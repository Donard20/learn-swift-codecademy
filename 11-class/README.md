 ## 🚀 Aim:
 
Introduction to Classes
  
So far, we’ve used several data types, including Int, Double, String, and Bool. We’ve even created our own “type” using structs to make blueprints and templates for objects in our program.

Besides structures, Swift has another construct that also serves as a blueprint or template for an object, a class! A class also defines the characteristics and behaviors of an object. While they feel and behave very similarly, classes come with additional quirks that structures don’t have:

Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another class.
Classes are reference types while structures are value types.
Suppose a company called Hooli gives out ID badges to its employees. Somewhere down the line, the powers that be decide to have a variation of the badges made just for all the managers.

So instead of creating the new badge template from scratch, we would use the employee badge template to create the manager badge template — that’s inheritance! Because managers are still employees, but also have their own special security clearance.

 ## 👨‍💻 Challenges and Exercises
 
<!-- <details>
  <summary>
  Swift Bank
  </summary>
  
 
We’ll use properties and access control to build a structure that represents a secure personal bank account. We will be able to initialize the account with a password and initial deposit, make deposits, make withdrawals, and check the balance.

For our bank to remain competitive and earn lots of new customers, we will offer a cash bonus every time a user makes a deposit. Additionally, we’ll configure a property observer to let us know whenever our bank balance is set so that we can display alerts.

We’ll apply the concept of structures, private methods, property observers, and type properties.

 > This project taught me how to develop a program using different porty controls and access controls. How to secure source code using private properties and methods to prevent it for modifying to the readers. I learned more how modules, properties, methods and instances communicate to one another using structure.

- [x] To model individual objects, we can create instances of structs which may have unique property values.
- [x] We can access and edit properties using dot notation.
- [x] If we know that most of our instances will have a specific property value, we can assign default property values inside the struct.
- [x] Using the init() method allows us to provide an instance with specific values for the structures given properties.
- [x] Even without an init() method, structs come with a default memberwise initialization method that can assign values to declared properties inside a struct.
- [x] Structures can have methods that are functions accessible to their instances.
- [x] Structures are value types, any copied struct that has its properties altered will not affect the original structure from which it was copied.
