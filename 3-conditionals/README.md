 ## 🚀 Aim:
Conditionals are powerful programming tools that introduce flexibility and complex behavior to a program by allowing it to react to change. 
 Their power comes from being the root of all decision making within an application.

  In this section, Im going to set up the rules and conditions for programs to follow using Swift’s conditional statements and operators.

## 🔥 Learned:

Here is a review of the lesson:

<!-- - [x] A variable represents a particular piece of your computer’s memory that has been set aside for you to use to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.
- [x] Variables are declared using the var keyword.
- [x] Constants are declared using the let keyword.
- [x] Swift basic data types include:
   - [x] Int: integers
   - [x] Double: floating-point numbers
   - [x] String: a sequence of characters
   - [x] Bool: true/false
- [x] Single equals sign = indicates assignment.
- [x] Arithmetic operators include +, -, *, /, %.
- [x] Compound assignment operators include +=, -=, *=, /=, %=.
