 ## 🚀 Aim:
Conditionals are powerful programming tools that introduce flexibility and complex behavior to a program by allowing it to react to change. 
 Their power comes from being the root of all decision making within an application.

  In this section, Im going to set up the rules and conditions for programs to follow using Swift’s conditional statements and operators.

## 🔥 Learned:

<!-- Here is a review of the lesson: -->

- [x] An if statement consists of a condition and code block that executes when the condition is true.
- [x] An else statement is immediately followed by a code block that executes when all previous conditions were false.
- [x] A code block is denoted by a set of curly braces {}.
- [x] Multiple else if statements can be chained within an if/else to provide additional conditions.
- [x] Comparison operators include <, >, <=, >=, ==, and != and are used to compare the values of two operands.
- [x] A switch statement looks for the value of a case that matches the value of an expression.
- [x] A switch statement can have cases that contain multiple items known as compound cases.
- [x] A switch statement’s case can include a range of values using the closed range operator (...).
