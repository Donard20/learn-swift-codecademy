 ## 🚀 Aim:
On a daily basis, we’re faced with making decisions based on certain conditions; if the weather is beautiful, we’ll go for a walk, or if it’s rainy, we’ll stay in and code!

In Swift, the ability to determine an outcome based on a given condition also exists. It’s known as a conditional.

Conditionals are powerful programming tools that introduce flexibility and complex behavior to a program by allowing it to react to change. Their power comes from being the root of all decision making within an application.

Your computer, for example, contains authentication processes whose logic is handled by conditionals. If you are logged out, access to certain pages on your device may be restricted, or if your are logged in, access will be granted.

> In this lesson, we’ll set up our own rules and conditions for programs to follow using Swift’s conditional statements and operators.

 ## 👨‍💻 Challenges and Exercises
 
 In this project, I'll be using conditional skills by creating a program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time.

## 🔥 Learned:

<!-- Here is a review of the lesson: -->

- [x] An if statement consists of a condition and code block that executes when the condition is true.
- [x] An else statement is immediately followed by a code block that executes when all previous conditions were false.
- [x] A code block is denoted by a set of curly braces {}.
- [x] Multiple else if statements can be chained within an if/else to provide additional conditions.
- [x] Comparison operators include <, >, <=, >=, ==, and != and are used to compare the values of two operands.
- [x] A switch statement looks for the value of a case that matches the value of an expression.
- [x] A switch statement can have cases that contain multiple items known as compound cases.
- [x] A switch statement’s case can include a range of values using the closed range operator (...).
